# UEFI-BootLoader: winload.efi

note: i just started. there is nothing usefull here yet. it is for testing github..


this project is a boot loader for a windows compatible OS used in a UEFI boot environment.

UEFI will be a 32 or 64 bit boot environment, dependend from the hardware. 
Some tablets have a 32bit UEFI and need the 32bit variant. check also the processor architecture.
A normal pc has a 64bit UEFI and need this bootloader as x64 variant.

this boot loader will be called directly with saved boot arguments (strings) or
from a boot manager. or the file is renamed to bootx.efi (32bit) or bootx64 (64bit) and copy into
/efi/boot on the boot disk by a setup programm. then the commandline for winload.efi will be empty.

this boot loader is a module in native PE format subsystem efi. 
winload.efi can be 32bit or 64bit, select in build.

winload.efi need to know the path to the system root device and a root directory path.
we provide a boot.ini in the directory where winload.efi is, /efi/boot in the EFI system partition of the boot disk.
if no boot.ini is found, winload.efi will search all volumes of the boot disk for a system-hive.
if nothing is found, winload.efi return to the UEFI boot environment.
can also look into other disks and ask if this shall be default boot and store in UEFI for next boot.

we give a Root device path to the volume. the volume becomes the root volume.
we give a Root path: c:\Windows or c:\Reactos or c:\NTOS.

the system registry hive file has the name "system" and is normal "C:\Windows\System32\config\system"
we can specify a other file path for the system hive file name with a cmdline parameter.
from the given info we will build filenames for the system registry file and all modules we load into memory.

each disk has a device id.
each volume on disk has a volume id.
we will use this id to build the root device path better then just the volume index. 
so we can move and copy the volumes with disk utilities and boot will always work.
the kernel will also remember its device id and root volume id in the system registry.
so if somebody just copy all the files from a working root volume to a new disk or volume. 
the kernel can recognize this and react acordingly. ask for a new name for the copied system.

to initialize a new boot disk under windows:
the disk can also be a virtual disk in a disk1.vhd file.
the attach the disk in disk management (datentr√§gerverwaltung).
you initialize the disk in GPT mode if not yet. 
create a EFI-system partition if not yet there. maybe need use diskpart for this.
create a volume for the operating system if not yet there. name it with your system name.
copy the files of the operating system into this volume. 
copy this winload.efi into /efi/boot of the efi system partition.


winload.efi do this:
1. create a loader parameter block struct (LPB). later we give this data to the kernel.

2. initialize boot parameter block:
copy given boot parameters from winload.efi-commandline or boot.ini into boot parameter block. 
save root device path and root directory path into boot parameter block. 
setup UEFI runtime service table so the kernel can call UEFI services for reboot, shutdown etc.
copy hardware info from UEFI tables into boot parameter block.
copy memory map info from UEFI into boot parameter block.

load the system registry file into memory as system-HIVE. save the handle in boot parameter block. 
from the boot config in the system hive we can get more details about the boot process:
which kernel modules, which boot drives ...
load kernel modules into memory: ntoskrnl.exe hal.dll bootvid.dll kdcom.dll ..
load boot drivers into memory:


3. call kernel entry point with the boot parameter block.

if any error occur while loading the system registry or the modules or when starting the kernel, we reboot .. warm start.
if the operating system (windows) is loaded normal, we never return from the kernel. the operating system will call
UEFI services directly for reboot or shutdown.

Todo: handle resume from a suspend to RAM or suspend to disk.
